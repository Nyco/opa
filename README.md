# Introduction

**Opa** is an **open-source XMPP chat client for the Web (SPA)** entirely built on top of **Vue** and **ElementUI** that follows the coolest trends out there ~~bye bye Flash and Desktop clients~~!

_**Trivia**_: "Opa", among many meanings in Brazil, is also used informally as a greeting!

**Opa** boasts a modern design having a clean interface that offers a good user experience. The interface is inspired by numerous web apps that already exist in the Javascript environment, such as **WhatsApp Web**, **Telegram Web**, **Discord**, **Rocket Chat**, etc...

**Opa** was born as an internal project to fill the **absence of an XMPP client** that did not need an **installation on each machine**, was **developed with current techs**, had a **modern design** and supported **common features** for a chat in a corporate environment.

# Getting Started

The initial idea of Opa was to be a plug-n-play client to any XMPP server and this was what influenced the decision to be a SPA and not a server-side-rendered application. 
Following this you have two ways of running this app:
- Cloning, configuration and building from the source, then hosting the /dist folder
- Using the Docker container provided and overwriting the global configuration file

## Installation
![alt text](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/social/docker_twitter_share_new.png "Docker Logo")

The installation with Docker is very straightforward. You will, however, need to connect to your XMPP server. To do that you need to overwrite the /config/app-config.json (explanation of each option in the config file is in [Configuration](#configuration)) file:
```bash
docker run --name opa -d --restart=always \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  --volume /opt/your-config.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/config/app-config.json \
  -m 256MB \
  credija/opa
```

Also, if you need to overwrite the HTTP server config (which is an NGINX), you will need to overwrite the nginx.conf like:
```bash
docker run --name opa -d --restart=always \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  -m 256MB \
  --volume /opt/your-nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf \
  credija/opa
```

Note: If you want to use a XMPP server in Docker we recommend our Openfire build which is available here: https://github.com/credija/openfire

## Configuration

To connect to a XMPP server you will need to overwrite the [app-config.json](public/config/app-config.json). The options are these:
- **VUE_APP_XMPP_SERVER_ADDRESS**: The address for the HTTP/S BOSH or WSS WebSocket connection.
- **VUE_APP_XMPP_SERVER_DOMAIN**: Your chat domain.
- **VUE_APP_EMOJI_SERVER**: The server where the emoji arts will be downloaded from:
  - This app already has the emojis it uses on its static folder so you only need to append "emoji/" to the domain where the app will be hosted, like: `opa.credija.com.br/emoji/`
- **VUE_APP_LOCALE**: The locale need to be set in the format "language-country", like "en-us", "pt-br", etc since this value will be used to format date through the app.

## Localization

Opa has a plug-n-play structure for localizations, who are get from 'i18n' folder in /public/config. 

If you want to test Opa but it doesn't has your language you can develop your own translation to the app following the example provided by [en-us.json](public/config/i18n/en-us.json). 

Once finished just put the translation on the 'i18n' folder and change your app-config.json **VUE_APP_LOCALE** option to the language code you choose. 

**Note:** It's important to remember that the file needs to follow the 'language-country.json' format which is the same used in the **VUE_APP_LOCALE** option.

**Important:** If you develop a translation don't be afraid and send a pull request on the 'public/config/i18n' folder so it can be added by default on the next updates of Opa!
